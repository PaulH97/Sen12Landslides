# README — technical validation splits (deprecated)

This folder contains the splits used for the technical validation reported in the paper. These splits are kept for reproducibility but are not optimal (a bit to many non-annotated samples).

Recommendation
- Use the canonical S12LS-LD splits instead. They contain the improved/validated split definitions and are the recommended source for downstream experiments.

Location
- Recommended: the repository's `S12LS-LD` directory (e.g. `Sen12Landslides/tasks/S12LS-LD`).

Usage
- Keep the files in this folder only for reproducing the paper results; do not use them for new experiments.
